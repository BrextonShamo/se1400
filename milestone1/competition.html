            <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
            <p>I want my website to stand out by making it neat, easily navigatable, and simple.
                 Something that might go wrong while making a website like this is there is too much happening, and not all the information can be found by users.
                I need to keep in mind that many people of different ages will probably use my website.</p>
